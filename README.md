- https://fbref.com/en/ (Data Source)
- Data was webscraped using Python's BeautifulSoup library
- Descriptive Statistics performed with R
- Simple dashboard created with PowerBI

## Purpose? Why?
This goal of this analysis was to see what variables most impact the amount of wins for a Premier League Soccer team.

## Results

The results were as expected, for the most part. Variables such as passing percentage, amount of goals, and the amount of goals postively impact the amount of wins a squad has.

Here is a visual plot created via R that shows the Average Shot Distance against the number of goals in a season. While not overly remarkable, I do find it interesting that the 16 range has the most amount of goals scored. It is apparent that teams that relied on far distance shots were less successful in scoring, possibly due to their inability to get closer to the goal in order to shoot.
